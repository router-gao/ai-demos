vGPU is a relatively complex topic than GPU pass-through mode.

What is vGPU software
The NVIDIA official vGPU Software Document is here.

vGPU software versions
vGPU software (hypervisor drivers, daemon software, guest OS drivers, etc) are similar to regular pGPU drivers. But they are not the same!





What is GPU Type
The number of physical GPUs that a board has depends on the board. Each physical GPU can support several different types of virtual GPU (vGPU). vGPU types have a fixed amount of frame buffer, number of supported display heads, and maximum resolutions. They are grouped into different series according to the different classes of workload for which they are optimized. Each series is identified by the last letter of the vGPU type name.

Q-series	Virtual workstations for creative and technical professionals who require the performance and features of Quadro technology
B-series	Virtual desktops for business professionals and knowledge workers
A-series	App streaming or session-based solutions for virtual applications users
NVIDIA vGPU is a licensed product on all supported GPU boards. A software license is required to enable all vGPU features within the guest VM. The type of license required depends on the vGPU type.

Q-series vGPU types require a vWS license.
B-series vGPU types require a vPC license but can also be used with a vWS license.
A-series vGPU types require a vApps license.
What is vGPU profile and required license
vGPU has different types.

That's the vGPU profiles that could be selected from vCenter GUI.

 

Use T4 GPU as an example.

https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/16.0/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#vgpu-types-tesla-t4

Find the license that match the vGPU profile. For example, A-series required license edition: vApps.



How to download vGPU software
There are 2 ways to download vGPU software bundle.

Download from VMware Intranet (NVIDIA account is not required)

Driver files intro
The screen shot below is a typical software packages from VMware Intranet.


ESXi driver files for ESXi 8 (install either zip file or vib file on ESXi 8):
NVD-AIE-800_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240_21957032.zip

NVD-VGPU-800_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240_21957031.zip

NVD_bootbank_NVD-AIE_ESXi_8.0.0_Driver_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240.vib

NVD_bootbank_NVD-VMware_ESXi_8.0.0_Driver_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240.vib



The difference between 'AIE' file and regular file is

NVD-AIE-800_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240_21957032.zip or NVD_bootbank_NVD-AIE_ESXi_8.0.0_Driver_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240.vib

This is the NVIDIA driver VIB for ESXi 7.0.2 that supports AI Enterprise GPUs like A100, A40 etc. It contains drivers optimized for AI and deep learning workloads.

Enables GPU virtualization features on ESXi for NVIDIA's Ampere architecture AI GPUs.

NVD-VGPU-800_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240_21957031.zip or NVD_bootbank_NVD-VMware_ESXi_8.0.0_Driver_535.54.06-1OEM.800.1.0.20613240.vib

This is the general NVIDIA driver VIB for ESXi 7.0.2 supporting various GPU models. It has drivers for GPUs like T4, M10, RTX etc. focused on visualization.

Enables vGPU support on ESXi for non-AI GPUs and use cases.

ESXi driver files for ESXi 7 (install either zip file or vib file on ESXi 7):
NVD-AIE-702_535.54.06-1OEM.702.0.0.17630552_21957109.zip

NVD-VGPU-702_535.54.06-1OEM.702.0.0.17630552_21957025.zip

ESXi daemon files (the same file for both ESXi7 and ESXi 8):
nvd-gpu-mgmt-daemon_535.54.06-0.0.0000_21957028.zip

Guest OS drivers:
